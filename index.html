              <p>Here's an example of a pretty awful website where my partner and I tried to re-create the wikipedia homepage! It's a lot of nested columns and rows. We also used bootstrap helper classes for styling.</p>

          <h1> About Me </h1>
          <div class="about-me-text">
          <p> I went to college at UC Santa Cruz and got a BA in Enviornmental Studies. After graduation, I worked for several years as an Inspector for Marin County Department of Agriculture/Weights & Measures. I most enjoyed working with farms helping get them certified Organic, but found myself most drawn to the more creative aspects of the job.</p>
          <p>I moved to Portland in 2016 and started working for a local construction company mostly doing residential remodels.  I liked the physical aspect of the job but was mostly fulfilled by the tasks that required high precision.  Trimming out windows beat framing walls any day.  Eventually I got a job working for The Joinery, a local hardwood furniture manufacturer.  I still work there today and really enjoy it.</p>
          <p>The work I'm currently doing has a suprising amount of parallels to coding.  They're both producing a product from the ground up where each step builds on the last.  It's taught  me to do things right the first time rather than waste time going back to fix mistakes, if you can even fix them at all.  Patience and conscientiousness are key. </p>
          <p>I really enjoy the experience I've had coding so far.  I've completed a Beginning Java course from Treehouse and am now in the middle of the Epicodus evening class. I'm excited to start learning Javascript and see what projects I can create in the digital realm after several years working on more physical projects.</p>
